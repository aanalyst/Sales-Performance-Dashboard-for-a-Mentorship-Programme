## Overall Insights

### Geographic Distribution
- **Northern Territory (NT)** is the top revenue contributor at approximately **$187k**, about 10% higher than the next state (NSW), indicating revenue concentration in NT.
- **Tasmania (TAS, ~$140k)** and **Australian Capital Territory (ACT, ~$151.8k)** are the lowest state contributors, suggesting opportunities to grow those markets or investigate lower demand.

### Operational Efficiency
- **Cancellations (103)** and **in-progress losses (110)** are material relative to services booked (387), pointing to operational friction points before delivery that could be targeted to improve yield.

### Seasonal Patterns
- Orders show clear **seasonality with peaks in March (95), August (97), and November (94)** and a mid-year dip in April (72), indicating higher demand in late summer and spring and a need for capacity planning aligned to these months.
- Month-to-month volatility in orders suggests recurring seasonal demand patterns that should inform staffing and inventory planning.

### Service Performance
- The **Mentoring program** is the dominant revenue driver with roughly **$651.6k in revenue** and the highest average unit price (~$1,200), making it critical to business performance.
- Lower-priced services (LinkedIn profile, Networking Strategy, Interview Prep) produce much less revenue despite moderate order counts, indicating revenue concentration in high-priced offerings and potential to upsell or reprice.

### Service-Specific Issues
- **Mentoring** has a moderate cancellation rate (9.8%) despite its high revenue and price, so small improvements in retention here could yield outsized revenue gains.
- **Networking Strategy** has the highest cancellation rate (12.0%) while generating the lowest revenue (~$81.8k), making it a prime candidate for service or process improvements to reduce churn.
- **Resume + LinkedIn Profile** generates substantial revenue (~$233.6k) but has a relatively high cancellation rate (11.4%), indicating that reducing cancellations in this offering could meaningfully increase net revenue.

## Recommendations

### Priority Actions

1. **Reduce Cancellation Rate**
   - Target the overall cancellation rate (10.3%) by prioritizing fixes in Networking Strategy and Resume + LinkedIn Profile (the highest cancellation services).

2. **Improve Conversion**
   - Tighten the pre-delivery process to convert more "Service Booked" and "In Progress" into delivered outcomes (targeting the largest drop-offs before delivery).

3. **Protect Core Revenue**
   - Protect and expand the Mentoring program (largest revenue and highest unit price) with retention-focused touchpoints and clear delivery milestones.

4. **Optimize Capacity Planning**
   - Plan staffing/capacity around demand peaks (Mar, Aug, Nov) and proactively stimulate demand in softer months (e.g., Apr).

5. **Geographic Expansion**
   - De-risk state concentration by scaling acquisition in underperforming markets (TAS and ACT) while maintaining momentum in NT and NSW.

6. **Revenue Optimization**
   - Increase revenue per customer by bundling/upselling from lower-priced services (Interview Prep, LinkedIn profile, Networking Strategy) into higher-value packages.
